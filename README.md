üé¨ Movie Recommendation System A content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on their similarity. Built with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

‚ú® Features Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies by analyzing plot keywords, genres, cast, and crew.

Interactive UI: A simple web interface built with Streamlit to easily find movie recommendations.

TMDb Dataset: Utilizes the rich "TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset".

üöÄ How It Works The recommendation logic is based on content-based filtering.

Data Preprocessing: Movie metadata (genres, keywords, cast, crew) is combined into a single text-based "tags" feature.

Vectorization: The "tags" for all movies are converted into numerical vectors using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique.

Similarity Calculation: The cosine similarity is computed between the vectors of all movies to determine how similar they are to each other.

Recommendation: When you select a movie, the system finds the movies with the highest cosine similarity scores and recommends them.
